For the first task we wrote a C program to calculate sum of ‘n’ numbers and obtained the output. This was to compare the compilation of the program in 
gcc vs riscv.  Then we ran the same program on the risc-v compiler and generated the object dump for -Ofast and -O1 optimization levels. Then we observed how the 
register is allocated for the data and how many bits of the register is occupied by the main program.
